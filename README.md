# Rust LSP Types

This library is meant to serve as a way to serialize and deserialize LSP JSON messages to Rust structs/enums.

All types are taken from https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/

Current Version: `3.17`

This is complete, but not everything is named super great (some names are very verbose).
I did this in basically 1 standing (thanks to Nvim btw).
I plan on using this and so I will refactor/rename as I use the types and better understand what they do and how they should be named.
Contributions and improvements are welcome.
